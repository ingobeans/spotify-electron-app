# what is this?

for some reason the spotify app sometimes doesn't work at all for me. the browser version does though, so i just made an electron app that just displays the web version. so in practice it's almost indistinguishable from the real app, just being more standard and hackable.

cool!

# plugins?

yeah i also added plugin support (why not). all scripts in plugins/ dir will be ran as soon as the page loads.
go ahead and customise spotify to your heart's content!
by default there's only a single script there that just removes the "Install App" button.
